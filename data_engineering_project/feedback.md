Good that the rubric was given this very often misses in other courses. 
This does not need to be and should not be masters course.

There was a lot of information that I already knew.
For instance during lecture 4 you spend a lot of time explaining a storage hierarchy.
From registers to cache to ram to persistent. But you can and should assume students know this if they are doing a cs master.
It felt a like you were giving these lectures with the audience in mind of a student that either did one R course or 1 database course.
This made everything very accessible but perhaps also limited the depths.

I do not think that you need to have a bachelors degree to understand this course at all
One database course will suffice. 
This is even more important as datascientist should be thought this even if they don't do a master.

# For quinten
Add an enter to the python implementation of database.
