# Questions to answer

    What dataset did you pick?

    What is the data model of the dataset (e.g. relational/graph/unstructured)?

    What is the storage format (e.g. JSON, CSV, RDF, raw text, Parquet, Images, etc.)?

    What is the size of the dataset (e.g. 5GB)?

    Does the dataset come from one source or multiple sources? What are the sources? (e.g. weather institute temperature data from different countries, JSON logs from web applications)

    How frequently (if ever) does the dataset need to be updated to stay relevant?

    Without going too in-depth, what can you already say about the data? For example, how many columns/rows does it have? Has it been preprocessed by someone else before, or is it “raw data”?

    Why did you pick this dataset, what do you intend to use it for?

        Feature extraction and preprocessing for a machine learning application (i.e. “getting the dataset ready for the data scientists”)

        Powering a dashboard or visualisation (i.e. “getting the dataset ready for the data analyst”)
